# Ruan's progress in C++
Hello! I created this repository to document my projects and progress on my journey
to proficiency in C++. Below is brief description of each file and it's purpose/problem statement.


## rabbit_spotting: 
SAMPLE INPUT FILE: rascally_rabbits.txt

This project further solidified the use of trig functions, logic, and the creation and use of functions, promoting compartmentalized programming.

The scenario is that there are fictional rabbits appearing in your backyard, and you want to track their comings
and goings. So you set up a robot that marks the military time and location of the rabbits as they appear.

The program outputs the time in minutes, the distance from robot, and the heading at which the rabbit appears.
It also keeps track of the shortest time between rabbit appearances, and outputs this value after iterating through all 
appearances.

## robotic-arm:
SAMPLE INPUT FILE:

This project included the use of trigonometry, looping, and file input to determine if a given coordinate pair is within reach of a robotic arm 
of x length. 

The input file starts with the arm length, and then y number of coordinate pairs.
The program outputs the coordinate pair of all pairs that are out of reach, as well as the total number of location that are out of reach.

## library_rules:
SAMPLE INPUT FILE: library_requests.txt

The assignment began a foundation in file i/o, as well as basic while loops and if statements.

You are the librarian of a fictional library. There are staff, students, and alumni with memberships. The rules of the library regarding borrowing and accessing items can be found in the code, and are different for each type of member. I will spare you the time of reading them here. 

The program opens a file containing user type, and material type data for various users instances. It then outputs the allowed duration and quantity that the user is allowed to borrow/access.
