# Ruan's progress in C++
Hello! I created this repository to document my projects and progress on my journey
to proficiency in C++. Below is brief description of each file and it's purpose/problem statement.


## rabbit_spotting: 
SAMPLE INPUT FILE: rascally_rabbits.txt

This project further solidified the use of trig functions, logic, and the creation and use of functions, promoting compartmentalized programming.

The scenario is that there are fictional rabbits appearing in your backyard, and you want to track their comings
and goings. So you set up a robot that marks the military time and location of the rabbits as they appear.

The program outputs the time in minutes, the distance from robot, and the heading at which the rabbit appears.
It also keeps track of the shortest time between rabbit appearances, and outputs this value after iterating through all 
appearances.
